# Tip_Calculator
The Tip Calculator calculates tip amount for various percentages of the cost of the service, and also provides a total amount that includes the tip.
The Shared Bill Tip Calculator considers the cost of the service, number of people, and chosen tip percentage to calculate the tip per person, as well as the total cost per person.
A tip or gratuity is an extra sum of money paid to certain service workers for a provided service. Tip amounts, as well as acceptance, vary in different parts of the world. In some countries in East Asia such as Japan, tips are seen as insulting and can sometimes be interpreted as a bribe. In yet other countries such as the United States, tipping is widely expected, and in many cases, is even factored into a service worker's compensation towards satisfying the minimum wage requirement. This is important to note, since although tipping is entirely voluntary, many servers depend on tips to make a living in countries like the United States.
